%   Each raw data file in data/data_mgl/F has the following vectors (in 
%    each case, columns are individual trials):
%     - decisionSum takes -1 if the decision was left side, and 1 if the 
%        decision was right side.
%     - labelSum takes 1 for trials after change point (TACP) 0, and 2 
%        for TACP 1, and 3 for TACP 2, and 4 for TACP 3, and 5 for TACP 4, 
%        and 0 for the rest. [NOTE FROM JIG: THIS IS HOW MY STUDENT TIM KIM
%        CODED THE DATA, SO I WANT TO KEEP IT IN THIS RAW FORMAT. HOWEVER, 
%        PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CODING SCHEME SEEMS OVERLY CONFUSING; I
%        WOULD HAVE CODED IT AS 0 FOR TACP=0, 1 FOR TACP=1, ETC]
%     - numdirSum takes -1 if the sound was left side, and 1 if the sound 
%        was right side.
%     - percorrSum is 0 if the subject's answer was incorrect, and 1 
%        if the subject's answer was correct.
%     - syncSum is 1 if the current trial is a "pupil trial" and 0 if 
%        the current trial is "RT trial" [NOTE FROM JIG: IGNORED HERE]
%     - tRxnSum is RT measured by mglGetSecs, where the RT is defined 
%        as the time when the eyes leave the fixation window. 
%        The fixation window was defined as 30% of the height and width of 
%        the screen (32.31cm x 51.69cm).
